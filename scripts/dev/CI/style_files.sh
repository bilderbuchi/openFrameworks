# Code styling script for CI builds

# Desired feature list:
# * If triggered by PR build, only style the files which changed in the PR
#   This can probably be done with some smart git magic
# * Make sure the script can meaningfully be called locally, too.

# Still to be implemented, remains a no-op for now
